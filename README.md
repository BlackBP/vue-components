# \[In developing\] A components library based on Vue.js.
I am still developing this package. You risk using it in production.

## If you still want to use this package

This component library needs to install the following dependencies:

1. Inputmask - [github](https://github.com/RobinHerbots/Inputmask)
2. Material Design Icons - [github](https://github.com/templarian/MaterialDesign/)
